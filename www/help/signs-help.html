<h2><a name="intro">Introduction and purpose</a></h2>

<p>SignS is web-based tool for gene selection and signature finding in
    problems where the dependent variable is patient survival or, more
    generally, a right-censored variable. Two approaches have been
    implemented: the <b>threshold gradient descent
    method (TGD)</b> of <cite>Gui & Lui (2005)</cite> and a method that uses a
    combination of gene filtering, clustering and survival model building (FCMS),
    very similar to the one used in <cite>Dave et al. (2004)</cite>.</p>

<p>There are other approaches that will analyze gene expression (in
      general, high-dimensional) data when the response is a
      right-censored variable. However, few other methods explicitly
      attempt to recover subsets of the original genes, preserving
      relevant genes even when these are highly correlated. Other
      approaches (e.g., PLS) will return predictive models, but offer
      little guidance as to selection of genes (i.e., prediction will be
      based on the complete set of original variables ---genes), or be
      intrinsically limited as to the maximum number of genes that can be
      used for fitting (such as the lasso). </p>

<p>These two approaches are, thus, promising regarding the above
      objectives (recovery of molecular signatures). It should be noted,
      though, that neither these, nor any other, approaches are still
      widely used, and that there have not been extensive studies
      comparing relative performance and characteristics. Thus, in
      contrast to other of our tools (e.g., <a
      href="http://pomelo.bioinfo.cnio.es">Pomelo</a>, <a
      href="http://tnasas.bioinfo.cnio.es">Tnasas</a>, or <a
      href="http://genesrf.bioinfo.cnio.es">GeneSrF</a>) the nature and
      status of these methods is much more experimental.   In addition,
      the implementation of this tool is still <b>largely experimental</b>. In
      particular, it is not obvious how to set one of the parameters for
      the threshold gradient descent method, and we are working on
      implementing several additional ideas for selecting the "best
      solution". Moreover, TGD is also very computationally demanding, and
      we are experimenting with different approaches to speed it up. Right
      now most of the execution is parallelized over 60 CPUs, but additional
      tricks and shortcuts could allow faster execution. In addition, it
      is not clear what is the most useful presentation of results, so we
      are of course open to comments and suggestions. Finally, we provide
      little checking of lack of convergence and similar problems; we are
      trying to figure out the best way to return this information to the user.</p>

<p>Regardless of the caveats, please enjoy and let us know your
      suggestions, comments and complaints.</p>


<h2><a name="methods">Methods implemented</a></h2>

<h3><a name="FCMS">"Filter, cluster, and stepwise model selection" as in
	Dave et al.  (FCMS)</a></h3>
<p>The "Filter, cluster, and stepwise model selection" method uses a
series of steps very similar to those in Dave et al. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Genes are filtered, using a univariate (gene-by-gene) Cox
	model. Only genes with a p-value (not adjusted for multiple
	comparisons) smaller than <b>Minimum gene-wise Cox p-value</b> are
	retained for further analyses. </li> 

      <li>Genes that fulfill the previous requirement are divided into two
	groups, those with a positive coefficient in the Cox model (i.e.,
	those genes for which an increase in their value is associated
	with a decrease in survival) and those with negative coefficients
	(increase in the gene associated to increased survival). (Yes,
	this is not a typo: the Cox model is a model of the hazard rate or
	hazard function ---the "instantaneous risk of death"; positive
	coefficients indicate a (relative) increase in the hazard, and
	thus a decrease in survival).</li>

      <li> Each of these two groups of genes is clustered separately. We
	have used complete-linkage hierarchical clustering with (1 -
	correlation) as the distance measure. This is a reasonable
	clustering method for genes (e.g., <cite>Simon et al.,
	2003</cite>) and eases the implementation of a correlation-based
	criterion for cluster selection (see next).</li>


      <li>A potential signature is a roup of genes that show a minimal
	correlation among themselves of <b>Min. correlation of genes in a
	cluster</b>, and that have between <b>Min. number of genes in a
	cluster</b> and <b>Max. number of genes in a cluster</b>. </li>


      <li>Note that the default settings for Min. and Max. numbers of
      genes in a cluster (10 and 100) are different from those used in
      Dave et al. (25 and 50). Other than interpretability and prior
      assumptions about size of "paths", I see no reason to use any
      particular set of values.</li>

      <li>The numeric values of a component (signature in the sense of
      Dave et al) are obtained by taking the average of the expression levels
      of all the genes in a given compnent.</li>

      <li>All possible pairs of signatures are then jointly fitted with a
      Cox model (i.e., a Cox model with two variables). The best
      two-signature model is retained (we choose as best the model with
      the largest likelihood) for the next step.</li>

      <li>We carry out stepwise variable selection using as starting point
      (and allowing both addition and deletion of terms) the best
      two-signature model from the step above. From the descriptions in
      the supplementary material of Dave et al., it seems they use
      p-values to retain or eliminate terms. We have used, instead, the
      AIC, a criterion which might be more suited for model selection. The
      components retained in the final models are used as the final
      selected components.</li>
    </ol>


<h3><a name="TGD">Threshold gradient descent for censored data of Gui and
	Li (TGD)</a></h3>

<p>This method, developed by Gui and Li, uses penalized likelihood, a
      general approach (with other examples such as the lasso and ridge
      regression) for obtaining estimates of the regression coefficients
      in high-dimensional spaces such as these (few subjects, thousands of
      features). This approach has close connections to the Lasso, but
      should overcome some of its limitations; for instance, the largest
      number of genes that can be selected by the Lasso can be no larger
      than the number of cases, and it tends to return only one of a set
      of genes that show high correlations.</p>

<p>Two parameters have to be set for this method: a threshold parameter
      &#964; (tau) and an infinitesimal increment &#8710;&#951; (Delta
      nu). The threshold parameter (where 0 &#8804; &#964; &#8804; 1) is
      related to the amount of penalization, and larger values lead to
      larger numbers of coefficients being set to 0. Delta nu is an
      infinitesimal increment that affects the rate of change of the
      coefficients at each iteration of the algorithm. </p>

<p>In <a href = "http://helix-web.stanford.edu/psb05/gui.pdf">their
	paper</a>, Gui and Li suggest using cross-validation to choose
	&#964; and &#951;. Actually, an operational approach is to decide
	in advance on a set of &#964; to examine (in our case, 0, 0.2,
	0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1), and use cross-validation to select the &#951;
	for each of the pre-specified &#964;. For each &#964;, we will
	chose the &#951; that minimizes the cross-validated partial
	likelihood (CVPL), a function of the difference in the log Cox's partial
	likelihoods for the models with and without the the ith group of
	subjects. Once we find the &#951; for a given &#964;, it is
	inmediate to obtain the fitted coefficients for the genes and the
	scores for subjects not in the sample.</p>

<p>From the <a href =
	"http://helix-web.stanford.edu/psb05/gui.pdf">original paper</a>,
	it seems that the authors used the CVPL to find the &#951; for a
	given &#964;, but it is not clear that this is the criterion
	ultimately used to select among &#964;. Rather, in the example
	discussed in their paper, the authors choose the final model based
	on the area under the ROC curve, and they use a set of data that
	includes both training and testing data subsets. We have (so far)
	only implemented selection based on the CVPL. Using roc curves has
	not yet been implemented, because of the additional computational
	demands, but we are working on the implementation of this (and
	another) approach for selecting the final &#964;, which can be
	used when we have no external testing data set.</p>

<p>Note that we scale (subtract the mean and divide by the standard
      deviation) each gene to prevent numerical problems that arise with
      some data sets when exponentiating the score function. This is in
      contrast to the <a href="http://dna.ucdavis.edu/~hli/gd1.SSC">R
      code</a> from the authors, which performed no scaling or
      centering. In the future, this scaling of the data will be optional,
      possibly based on the existence of numerical problems. Note that
      when using scaled data the interpretation of the effects of
      coefficients does not depend on the variance of a gene, and all
      coefficients refer to the effect of a change in 1 s.d. unit of the
      gene.</p>


<h3><a name="errorstab">Assessment</a> of predictive performance and stability</h3>

<p>Assessing predictive performance with censored data is more complex
      than with, say, classification data, and several alternative
      approaches have been suggested. Here, we provide a simple graphical
      approach, popular in the gene expression literature: for each case,
      we obtaine its out-of-bag cross-validated prediction (i.e., the
      prediction from a model in which that subject was not used at all in
      any of the steps of the model building). Using the out-of-bag
      predictions we divide all subject into two groups, those with high
      scores and those with low scores (i.e. we split them into two
      equally sized groups). Then, we <a name="kmplot">plot the survival curves</a>and compare
      the survival of the two groups with a log-rank test.</p>

<p>It must be emphasized that these are out-of-bag predictions, so these
      are predictions for each subject obtained from a <b>complete</b>
      model building process where that subject was not involved. For
      comparison, we also provide the "overfitt" plots where the scores
      used to split the subjects are "resubstitution" scores.</p>


<p>Stability is assessed showing the parameters chosen in each
      crossvalidation run (for TGD) and
      the signatures, their coefficients, and the composing genes (for
      FCMS). For both methods we show the frequency with which each
      selected gene appears in the output, and the percentage of
      coincidence between the different runs. (See <a
      href="#output">output</a> section, below).</p>

 

    <h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
    
    <h3><a name="input">Input</a></h3>

    <h4><a name="covariates">Expression data file</a></h4>
    <p>The file with the covariates; generally the gene 
    expression data. In this file, rows represent variables (generally genes),
    and columns represent subjects, or samples, or arrays.</p>

    <p> The file for the covariates should be <a name="requirements">formated</a> as:</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>Data should conform to the "genes in rows,  patients (or arrays) in columns". 
          In other words, each row of the data file is supposed to represent a different gene 
          or variable.</li> 
      <li>Use tab (\t) as the field separator within rows.</li> 
      <li>Use newline or carriage return (\n) between rows. It is also convenient to finish a 
              file with one carriage return (\n).</li> 
      <li>Array names: if you want to name your arrays (useful for the output of
	the analyses) do as follows:
	<ol>
	  <li>Place a line that starts with "&#035;";</li>
	  <li>After the "&#035;" put "Name" or "NAME" or "name" (don't say we
	    don't give you choices);</li>
	  <li>Write the array names (separated by tabs).</li>
	</ol>
      <li>The first column is assumed to contain the ID information for genes, marker, 
        or whatever. This will be used to label the output (but it also means that whatever is 
        in the first column is not used in the analyses). Please note that
        shorter names work better when labeling dendrograms.</li> 
      <li>You can have an arbitrary number of rows with comments. These rows must always start 
        with an "&#035;".</li>
	    <li><b>Gene names and array names MUST be unique</b>. If
	      they are not, the program will let you know. If you do
	      not want to provide array names, that is OK, and we will
	      name them with sequential integers starting at 1. If you
	      do not want to provide gene names, then put some
	      arbitrary labels on the first column (e.g., fill it with
	      a sequence of integers).
	      Why do we need gene and array names to be unique?
	      Because in many steps, we need to provide either where
	      we classify a given array (and what should we do if two
	      or more arrays are named "A"?), or the genes used in the
	      classifier (and what should we do if two or more genes
	      are named "gene B"?).</li>

      <li><b>Missing values are NOT allowed</b>. You can use the 
	      <a href="http://gepas.bioinfo.cnio.es/cgi-bin/preprocess">preprocessor</a> and do
	      several things with your data before sending it
	      to Tnasas. We would probably recommend you do imputation after
	      eliminating genes with too many (more than, say, 20&#037;?) missing. Anyway,
	      how best to deal with missing values is not a trivial issue and is outside
	      the scope of this help file.
      
      <li> This is a small covariate data file: 
        <div class="color"> 
          <pre> 
#Name     ge1      ge2      ge1      ge1      ge2 
gene1   23.4    45.6    44      76      85.6 
genW@   3      34      23      56      13 
geneX#  23      25.6    29.4    13.2    1.98   </pre> </div> 
        </li> 

    </ul>
    

    
    <h4><a name="time">Survival time file</a></h4> 

    <p>A tab-separated text file with the survival or duration time (e.g.,
time to death, time to relapse).  These data can be
right-censored. Separate values by tab (\t), and finish the file with a
carriage return or newline.  No missing values are allowed here.</p>

    <p>Please note that we do not allow any data set with 10 or fewer
    cases. In terms of statistical analysis, the "true sample size" of
    right-censored data is often much smaller than the number of cases,
    and even 20 cases are way too few.</p>

        <p>It is your responsability to make sure the assumptions for
      these data hold. The models work for right-censored data. See usual
      caveats/discussions on other types of censoring, informative
      censoring, etc. </p>

    <h4><a name="event">Survival status (event) file</a></h4> 
<p>A tab-separated text file indicating if the event (e.g., death, relapse)
was actually observed (this is indicated with a 1) or not (a 0); cases for
which the event was not observed are the right-censored cases. </p>

<p>Same format as above:  Separate values by tab (\t), and finish the file with a
carriage return or newline.  No missing values are allowed.</p>


    <h4><a name="validation">Validation data</a></h4> 
      <p>If you have
    validation data, you can enter them here. It is rarely a good idea to
    keep a fraction of the data for validation; statistics has shown
    repeatedly that cross-validation and the bootstrap are much better
    procedures (specially in terms of variance of estimates) than setting
    appart a chunck of the data. (A quick, and not quite fully correct,
    explanation: Setting appart a chunk of the data is, if you think of
    it, like a "poor man's cross-validation", because you do once what
    10-fold CV does 10 times; and means of 10 samples have smaller
    variances than one sample). Thus, unless you have a very good reason, 
      <b>do not use the validation data option</b>.

      <p>But there are situations when you might have validation
      data. Suppose you have a sample of 200 from a study, and another
      sample of, say, 100 from a similar study but with samples from a
      different hospital or different country. It is probably a bad idea
      to put together all 300 cases as if they were a homogenous
      sample. You can, instead, train your model with the 200 samples and
      validate it on the 100. This provides also some indication about
      whether what you find on the first hospital/country is useful for
      the second hospital/country.</p>

    <p>However, DO
      NOT (I repeat DO NOT) keep playing around with the parameters until things
      look nice with the validation data. That would be a <b>serious case of
	overfitting</b>. Why? Well, obviusly because you would be using
      your validation sample to choose the "best parameters", and
      thus the validation sample would not be validating anything at all.</p>


    <p>Of coruse, you can play, to your hearts content, with the
      parameters using the training data (ONLY the training data). You can
      do this as many times as you wish (or you have patience for). Then,
      once you are satisfied with the parameters found with your training
      data, run SignS, using training and validation data, with the very
      same parameters you just found. </p>

    <p>Please remember that the validation data are just that, validation
      data, and should be used to validate a model (not to find good
      settings of the parameters). Of course, we cannot prevent you from
      doing this, and the problem of this tool is that it is open to
      abuse. But if you do abuse it, you must be fully aware that this is
      a clear case of overfitting and cannot be called validation. </p>

<h4><a name="idc">Type of gene identifier and species</a></h4>
<p>If you use any of the currently standard identifiers for your gene IDs
for either human, mouse, or rat genomes, you can obtain additional
information by clicking on the names in the output figures. This
information is returned from <a
href="http://idclight.bioinfo.cnio.es">IDClight</a> based on that provided
by our <a href="http://idconverter.bioinfo.cnio.es">IDConverter</a>
tool.</p>


    
    <h3><a name="output">Output</a></h3>
    <h4><a name="outputPlots">Plots</a></h4>

    <p> The plots depend on the method used. For both TGD and FCMS we show
    the <a name="outKM">survival</a> plots as explained <a href="#kmplots">above</a>. </p>
    
    <p>For <a name="out.fcms">FCMS</a> we also show the dendrograms
    from the clustering of the positive and negative coefficient genes
    (after the p-value filtering), indicating with colors the groups
    that meet the restrictions of size and minimum correlation. Again,
    these are the clusters that survive the filtering for p-value. And
    we use color to show those that suvive the filtering in terms of
    maximum and minimum size of clusters. All, some, or none of these
    might be finally selected by the Cox model.</p>

    <p>Additionally, no particular meaning is to be assigned to the
    cluster names. We simply name all clusters for genes with positive
    coefficients starting with a "P", and those for genes with
    negative coefficients starting with a "N". But the numbers
    themselves mean nothing in particular (they have to do with depth
    and layout in the plot). Please do not try to interpret or assign
    any meaning to them; they are just names.</p>

    <p>Few "automatically generated" and static dendrograms are to
    everybody's satisfaction; how well things look depends on the
    dendrogram, whether or not we annotate with labels, the size of the
    labels, etc. <b>NEW</b> We now provide dendrograms with all nodes
    labeled or only the selected clusters labeled. In addition, you can
    get additional information about each node by clicking on it, if you
    provided information about the organism and the type of id (and those
    identifiers are among the ones used
    by <a
    href="http://idconverter.bioinfo.cnio.es">IDConverter</a>). Moreover,
    you can choose among three different sizes for the dendrograms. The names of the
    cluster/signature in the labels of the figures correspond to the names
    in the textual output. </p>
    
    <p>For TGD we show a plot of the CVPL (cross-validate partial
    likelihood) versus &#951; for different values of &#964;. You would
    want to see six U shaped lines, with the bottom of the U far from the
    maximum you set for <b>Maximum iterations</b>; note that this maximum
    might not be shown in the figure. You might see that different lines
    finish at differetn &#951;: one algorithm we have implemented (and
    which might be running when you use the program) allows
    for "early stopping" when it is obvious we are getting away from the
    best &#951;, and this is likely to happen at different &#951; for
    different &#964;. For TGD we also showm, following the <a href =
    "http://helix-web.stanford.edu/psb05/gui.pdf">original paper</a> of
    Gui and Li, the values of the coefficients for different settings of
    &#964;, to allow to obtain a quick idea of the amount of
    regularization and sets of genes likely to be important.</p>


    <h4><a name="outputText">Textual output</a></h4>
    <h5>Single-gene statistics and p-values</h5>
    <p><b>NEW</b> We now provide several tables (ordered using different
    criteria) that show the p-values and coefficients for the single-gene
    (or gene-by-gene) Cox models that are the first part of the FCMS method.</p>

    <h5><a name="f1">OOB predictions</a></h5>
    
    <h5><a name="f2">OOB predictions</a></h5>
    <p>For each sample, its out-of-bag score. This is just the matrix
    product of the coefficients and the value of the covariates. It is
    unlikely to provide any insight by itself, but allows to order cases,
    see which are very far away from others, etc. Again, we emphasize that 
      these are out-of-bag predictions, so these
      are predictions for each subject obtained from a <b>complete</b>
      model building process where that subject was not involved. In other
    words, as in <a href="http://tnasas.bioinfo.cnio.es">Tnasas</a> and <a
    href="http://genesrf.bioinfo.cnio.es">GeneSrF</a> we do what is
    sometimes called "double or full cross-valdation".</p>

    
    <h5>Model results and parameters</h5>
    <p>Each of TGD and FCMS have somewhat slightly different output,
    that shows the results of the models fitted, parameters used,
    etc. The output should be self-explanatory. (If it is not, please
    let me know, and I'll do my best to fix it).</p>

    <p>Some explanatory notes for FCMS:</p>

    <ul>
    <li> The names of clusters in different runs are not
    comparable. For instance, a cluster called N.2 in the original run
    and a cluster called N.2 in the first CV run might, or might not,
    be somewhat similar, but in general they will be very different
    things (the only common feature is that they both group genes with
    negative coefficients).</li> 

    <li> The coefficients shown always refer to the Cox-model
    coefficient of each specific cluster and, again, are not
    comparable among different runs. For instance, do not try to
    compare the coefficient for component P.4 in CVrun1 and in CV
    run3. That would not make any sense.</li>

    <li>The number of clusters obtained (before any Cox-model
    building) that survive the filtering steps need not be the same in
    different CV runs. In fact, this information is unlikely to be of
    much use, and thus it is not provided.</li>

    <li>The number of genes per cluster can be completely different in
    different runs (CV and all data). Of course, all of the finally
    selected clusters in any run will satisfy the restrictions you set
    when running the application in terms of maximum and minum number
    of genes per cluster, and minimal correlation between any two
    genes in a cluster. But it is possible that, say, in one run you
    get two clusters, all of possitive coefficients, each with 8
    genes, in another run you get one cluster of nine genes with
    negative coefficients, and in another run you get one cluster with
    six genes with negative coefficietns and one cluster of 15 genes
    with positive coefficients.</li>

    <li>All these differences between runs and lack of comparability
    might seem confussing: they are here because it is perfectly
    possible to get many great results, but which share very little
    (in terms of genes and clusters) among them. Part of the point of
    showing the results from the CV runs is to alert you to this
    fact. With some data sets results tend to be very stable from run
    to run; with some others they don't.</li>

    
    </ul>



    <p>For TGD, the complete list of all the genes selected for the six
    different values of the threshold (tau) are listed in the file
    "genes.all.out", which you can download with the rest of the output
    (see <a href="#download">below</a>).</p>
    
    <h5><b>Stability assessments</b></h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Genes selected in each of the cross-validation runs.</li>
      <li>Number of shared genes. The number of genes selected in
	common between any two runs (e.g., between the run with the
	complete sample and the 2nd cross-validated run, or between
	the 4th and 7th cv run). Of course, this is a symmetric matrix.</li>
      <li>Proportion of shared genes (relative to row total). This
	is the above table divided by the total number of gene
	selected by the procedure of the given row. So suppose the
	third row, the 2nd cv run, selected 20 genes. Then the third
	row of this table is the same as the third row of the table
	above divided by 20. Thus, this is not a symmetric
	matrix.</li>
      <li>Gene freqs. in cross-validated runs of genes selected in
	model with all data. Take each of the genes selected from the
	complete data run, and count how many times it shows up in
	the selections from the cross-validation runs.</li>
      <li>Gene frequencies in cross-validated runs. Count how many
	times any gene (that shows up at least once in the
	cross-validation runs) appeared among the selected ones in
	the cross-validation runs.</li>
    </ol>

<h5>Validation data</h5>
<p>We provide the linear scores; these are just the matrix product of
    the coefficients times the value of the covariates (i.e., the
    selected clusters). It is unlikely to provide any insight by
    itself, but allows to order cases, see which are very far away
    from others, etc.</p>

<h4><a name="download">Download figures and results</a></h4> <p>You can download a single
compressed file with all figures, in both the png format showed in the web
results as well as in pdf format ---which gives better quality for
printing---, and results (a single text file). The format is tar.gz,
understood by GNU's tar, standard in GNU/Linux distributions, and also
understood by the common uncompressors/unzipers/etc in other operating
systems.</p>




<h4><a name="pals">Sending results to <a
href="http://pals.bioinfo.cnio.es">PaLS</a> (<FONT
COLOR="red">New!!</FONT>) </h4>
<p>It is now possible to send the results to <a
href="http://pals.bioinfo.cnio.es">PaLS</a>.  PaLS "analyzes sets
of lists of genes or single lists of genes. It filters those
genes/clones/proteins that are referenced by a given percentage of
PubMed references, Gene Ontology terms, KEGG pathways or Reactome
pathways." (from <a
href="http://pals.bioinfo.cnio.es/help/pals-help.html">PalS's
help</a>). By sending your results to PaLS, it might be easier to make
biological sense of your results, because you are "annotating" your
results with additional biological information.</p>


<p>Scroll to the bottom of the main outpu, where you will find the
<img src="../palsfavicon40.png" align="middle">PaLS icon and the gene
list (the list of selected genes used in the models). When you click
on the link, the corresponding list of genes will be sent to
PaLS. There, you can configure the options as you want (please,
consult <a
href="http://pals.bioinfo.cnio.es/help/pals-help.html">PalS's help</a>
for details) and then submit the list. In PaLS, you can always go
back, and keep playing with the very same gene list, modifying the
options.</p>





 <h3><a name="speed">How long does it take?</a></h3> 

<p>With the default
settings, FCMS takes about 5 minutes on the 78 patients by 4751 genes
breast cancer data set of van't Veer et al. (2002, Nature, 415: 530--536),
and the 160 patients and 7399 genes DLBCL data set of
Rosenwald et al. (2002, N. Eng. J. Med, 346: 1937--1947). With the default settings, TGD 
takes about 2 hours with the van't Veer data set (and about 4 with the DLBCL data set).
These are timings when the server was moderately loaded
      (about 50% of the CPUs being completely busy with another task).</p>



<h3><a name="examples">Examples</a></h3>
